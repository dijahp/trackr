# Trackr

This is a small application that can be used to log daily events and behaviors.  Included in this repository are the necessary scripts to download and develop locally, along with provisioning files for a mock database.

## Trackr Use Cases

Use this to track when you're working out, taking a specific medication, or when you've spent some time practicing a particular skill.  Use the dashboard to see how you're keeping up on those tasks, and whether there's any daily events that you haven't gotten to yet.  Use it to track health events (allergies, affect, and medication), behaviors (meditation, working out, practicing a skill), or chores (ending the day without dishes, etc).

# How to Use this Repository

This project allows you to clone the repo and start up a local development environment.  This will give you the ability to edit and run server-side code (PHP) on your preferred computer.  From there, you can look at common issues, fork a copy, and make pull requests.

### Getting Started

This repository contains the setup files in the DEV directory.  In this folder you'll find an additional README that provides details on how to set up this on your own machine.  Thanks to John H from **The Research Group** [on Github](https://github.com/The-Research-Group "The Research Group") for writing and sharing that code.  The code for the application itself can be found under the html folder.

Please note that the DEV environment code is distributed under a different license.  If you would like to re-use the code from that project, get in touch with them first.

### Contributing

If you see a change you'd like to make, go ahead and fork a copy of this repository and make a pull request.  If you're looking for ideas, check through the 'issues' section of the repo to see if there are any that you think you'd like to try your hand at.  If you're interested in an issue but would like help understanding the codebase, feel free to leave a comment on the issue.

### Don't Ignore the .gitignore

Some files don't need to be tracked by version control, sometimes because they contain sensitive information and other times they contain local information (like logs) that aren't relevant to others.  For this repository, the .gitignore file is not tracked, but when you clone it, you may find a number of files that are worth ignoring.
